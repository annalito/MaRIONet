Hi network members,

We want to run our MaRIONet launch meeting in London early 2017. Please fill in the doodle poll below to indicate when you are free to attend this event. At the launch meeting we will introduce the manycore network, outline the schedule of activities, and run the first industrial/academic "speed dating" session. We also hope to have a "New Cross-ICT Priorities" overview from the EPSRC ICT team.

Please doodle at http://doodle.com/poll/p2crvxhc6q5shecs

Many thanks,
Jeremy

Hi Ally,
according to our poll at

Wed 11 Jan is looking like a good date. Please could we go ahead and arrange the MaRIONet launch meeting at Imperial for this date?

Many thanks
Jeremy

Dear MaRIONet member,

This is the second of our regular network newsletters to update you
about activities in the UK manycore network.


=========
1) MaRIONet at HiPEAC '18
=========

The HiPEAC network is holding its annual conference in Manchester, 22-24 Jan 2018. We have a MaRIONet workshop on Wed 24 Jan.
* We want to showcase UK manycore research at HiPEAC. Please volunteer to give a 30 min presentation about your project by emailing jeremy.singer at glasgow.ac.uk
* Remember to sign up for the MaRIONet workshop when you register for the HiPEAC conference.
* There will be a dragon's den style pitching competition at the workshop. We are looking for volunteers to pitch their wild and crazy ideas to the dragons!

2) Manycore Summer School
========

The flagship activity of MaRIONet will be a PhD and Early Career Summer School, to be held in Glasgow, Mon 16 to Fri 20 July 2018.

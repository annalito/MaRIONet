Reliable, Secure and Scalable Software Systems (RS4) Workshop

1st September  2017

Call for Presentations and Participation

The era of many-core computing is transforming much of computing and areas like AI, sensor nets, IoT, and big data are just some examples. Many-core software systems have three main components: computation, i.e. the algorithms to be performed, data encoded in data structures and data stores, and communication between compute units:

  Software Systems = Computation + Data + Communication


Such systems must resolve three inter-linked challenges in each of the components to be:

  *   Scalable: emergent computing platforms operate at unprecedented scale, with commodity servers already commonly comprising hundreds of hosts, tens of thousands of cores, and thousands of storage devices.
  *   Reliable: systems must tolerate and recover from hardware, software and network failures.
  *   Secure: Systems are increasingly connected, and hence vulnerable to misuse and attack.

RS4 is a 1 day workshop that brings together academic and industrial researchers to outline both challenges and promising approaches.


The workshop is sponsored by SICSA <https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/&sa=D&ust=1493737890000000&usg=AFQjCNHCGsvuCaQk7g-PjajuAhWW3BdX-Q> http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/&sa=D&ust=1493737890001000&usg=AFQjCNFfbwTh1FhPb1oEEQEpaA61CEoNPQ>  and the EPSRC <https://www.google.com/url?q=http://manycore.org.uk&sa=D&ust=1493737890002000&usg=AFQjCNGgwtzVA-KSwnnQCH0kr23uo95iiA> MaRIONet<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://manycore.org.uk&sa=D&ust=1493737890002000&usg=AFQjCNGgwtzVA-KSwnnQCH0kr23uo95iiA> Manycore Network, and is part of the 60<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890003000&usg=AFQjCNHrCEY868HNi7uT6aexjhi6JTWe-g>th<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890004000&usg=AFQjCNFXeCqjZm2I1qBfRBI2GETA_SnkDA> anniversary of the School of Computing Science, at the University of Glasgow<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890005000&usg=AFQjCNEBxMr2R9MRn793ll3oZfNzW2VlPw>

Dear MaRIONet member,
 
This is the first of our regular network newsletters to update you
about activities in the UK manycore network.


=========
1) UKMAC '17 Workshop - Warwick - Tue 11 July 
=========
 
The annual UK Manycore Developer Conference (UKMAC) will be held at
Warwick University on Tuesday 11 July.  MaRIONet is sponsoring this
event, so registration will be free this year.  We are currently
looking for presentations: if you would like to give a talk, please
email natascha.harth@glasgow.ac.uk with a short abstract. Visit
http://manycore.org.uk/ukmac2017.html for more details about UKMAC '17,
including the online registration form.


========
2) Launch Event Feedback
========
 
Around 60 people attended the MaRIONet launch meeting in January at
Imperial College London. We would like to archive slides and photos from
this meeting at http://manycore.org.uk/London_jan17.html - if you
presented slides but you do not want them on the website, please let
us know by Monday 15 May. If you have any photos or general feedback
from the launch event, please email natascha.harth@glasgow.ac.uk with
details.


===========
3) Members database
===========

When we received funding from EPSRC, we agreed to provide a public
directory of manycore researchers in the UK. We intend to host this
directory on our website. Again, if you do _not_ want your name to be on
this list, please inform natascha.harth@glasgow.ac.uk by Monday 15 May.


============
4) Future events
============

There is a list of upcoming manycore research events at
http://manycore.org.uk/events.html
If you would like to add an event to our list, please get in touch.
We also provide funding to cover expenses (catering, room hire,
speaker travel) if you want to host your own event. Again, please
get in touch for more details.


============
5) News updates
============

If you have any news items for the next edition of the MaRIONet
newsletter, please send them directly to natascha.harth@glasgow.ac.uk
or tweet us on @UKManycore



Many thanks,
Jeremy (MaRIONet coordinator)
and 
Natascha (Network administrator)

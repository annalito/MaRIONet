Subject: [Marionet] Reliable Scalable and Secure Software (RS4) Workshop
	Summary
Message-ID: <9FA592BC1DE81E4CAAC9F278ED754C880FEA936F@CMS08-01.campus.gla.ac.uk>

Folks,

We had a very productive workshop in Glasgow on the 1st September with 7 talks and some plenary discussion. It was attended by some 50 people with a good mix of industrial and academic speakers and participants. There were presentations from high profile industrialists: Alastair Reid (ARM), Alastair Murray (Codeplay Software), Michele Weiland (EPCC), David Irvine (Maidsafe) and Tony Printezis (Twitter), and participation from leading universities: including Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Heriot-Watt.

We discussed the challenges of engineering reliable scalable and secure software (RS4) for emergent platforms, and some possible approaches to solving them.

Attached is a summary of the workshop, and the full materials, including most sets of presentation slides are available from the workshop pages:

Best Regards,

Inah and Phil

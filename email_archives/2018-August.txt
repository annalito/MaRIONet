Hi all,

Our network is now more than half-way through its EPSRC funding
duration. We have organized a range of events across the country over
the past two years, with further upcoming events announced below. Do
get in touch if you would like to host your own Manycore workshop.

In other news, we have produced some MaRIONet laptop stickers. Email
jeremy.singer at glasgow.ac.uk with your snail mail address if you want
us to post you a laptop sticker.

Best regards,
Jeremy

Network member Jose Nunez-Yanez from Bristol is organizing a workshop
on Next-Generation Hardware for High-Performance Computing, to be held
in Bristol, 11 Sep 2018. Lots of great speakers and interesting talks.

The UK Manycore summer school was held at the School of Computing
Science, 16-20 July. We welcomed over 40 visitors, most of them were
UK-based PhD students but we had some delegates from exotic places
like ETHZ and Princeton. Speakers included representatives from
industry and academia.

Over the week, students found out about various aspects of manycore
technology, from low-level processor architecture, through virtual
machines and programming languages, up to high-level applications. We
also enjoyed an excursion to Loch Lomond and a ceilidh at the student
union, to give our visitors an authentic taste of Scotland.

The summer school was possible thanks to generous sponsorship from
EPSRC and SICSA. Slides and photos are archived at

PRiME is pleased to announce the release of PRiME Framework which
enables application- and platform-agnostic runtime management.  Being
able to balance the competing needs of application performance with
the minimisation of system power is essential for future systems and
one way to achieve this is with application-aware runtime management
of system behaviour. There are many runtime management approaches;
however, many are tied to specific hardware or applications, this
makes direct comparison challenging and complicates implementation
with new platforms and applications.  PRiME researchers have developed
a tool, Prime Framework, for application and platform agnostic runtime
management that enables portability of runtime management
approaches. We achieve this by considering a system as three distinct
layers with abstracted communication between them.  The PRiME
Framework has two main features: It allows users, who are developing
runtime managers for new systems, to directly compare different
approaches to identify the best one or check how well their approach
compares to the state of the art. It simplifies development effort as
runtime managers don't need device or application specific code
allowing the users to quickly prototype and test an idea in a few
lines of code. "The PRiME Framework is a step change in cross-layer
system optimisation of future many-core and heterogeneous systems. It
benefits runtime management researchers and developers by reducing
development overhead and enabling the direct comparison of
approaches," said Professor Bashir Al-Hashimi. Details of the tool
methodology have been accepted for publication in ReCoSoC 2018 and PEC
2018 both of which will be published shortly.  PRiME Framework is
available to download on:

<Programming> 2019 : The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming

April 1-4, 2019, Genova, Italy
http://2019.programming-conference.org

********************************************************
CALL FOR WORKSHOPS
********************************************************

https://2019.programming-conference.org/track/programming-2019-Workshops

To build a community and to foster an environment where participants can 
exchange ideas and experiences related to practical software 
development, ‹Programming› will host a number of workshops, during the 
days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a 
collaborative forum to exchange recent and/or preliminary results, to 
conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic, or to coordinate 
efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are 
intended as a forum for lively discussion of innovative ideas, recent 
progress, or practical experience on programming and applied software 
development in general for specific aspects, specific problems, or 
domain-specific needs. We also encourage practical, hands-on workshops 
in which participants actually experience one or several aspects of 
practical software development. 

The duration of workshops is in general one day, but we encourage the 
submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. In 
exceptional situations, e.g., for workshops that involve actual practice 
of programming-related activities, workshop organizers can request a 2 
day workshop slot. If desired, the workshop proceedings can be published 
in the ACM Digital Library. 


### Submission Deadlines

Deadline: September 1st, 2018

Notifications will go out as soon as possible, about a week after the deadline.

### Workshop Selection Committee

Walter Cazzola (Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy)  
Stefan Marr (University of Kent, UK)

### Submission and Workshop Process

Please submit your workshop proposal electronically via the submission system:
https://2019.programming-conference.org/createProposal/b8c42d64-0e25-4255-ab8e-dceb6acd53db
Please adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines given below and provide all requested information about the proposed workshop.

Please keep it brief and use the provided form. The intention is not to spend time proposal writing, but preparing the organization of the workshop.

To coordinate with the deadlines of the main conference, the following deadlines have to be respected by workshops:

**Workshop web site and CFP:** September 17th.  

**Deadline for submissions to the workshops:**

 - after December 1st 2018 (first notification issue 3)
 - possibly after January 7th 2019 (final notification issue 3), if this is feasible
 - no later than January 15th 2019

**Notification of authors:** February 15th, the latest. Needs to be before the early registration deadline around February 25th 2018.  

**Deadline for Camera-Ready Papers (ACM DL):**

 - for pre-proceedings before March 1st
 - for post-proceedings before May 1st

**Workshop dates:** April 1st or 2nd 2019

### Workshop Proposal Guidelines

Please include the following information either directly in the proposal, or CFP.
The submission system has a form that includes an abstract (for the website), the CFP, and the remaining proposal.
CFPs often cover the same information, duplication is not necessary for such cases.

1. What is the motivation for the workshop?
   - Objectives
   - Intended audience
   - Relevance (with respect to the topics of the <Programming> conference)
2. Who organizes the workshop?
   - Organizers and primary contact (name / affiliation / email)
   - Brief details on the organizers (previous workshop organizing experience, etc.)
   - Data on potential previous iterations of the workshop
       - How many participants do you expect (please make at least an educated guess)
       - What kind of equipment do you need (e.g., data projector, computer, whiteboard)
   - Advertisement: Planed advertisement strategy to ensure sufficient participation
3. Is there going to be a workshop program committee?
   - if so, please list the members (indicated as finalized or expected)
4. What is the planed workshop format?
   - Planned deadlines
   - Intended paper format
   - Evaluation process
   - Intended publication of accepted papers (printed proceedings or website)
       - either as pre or post proceedings
   - Intended workshop format (including duration, number of presentations, and planned keynotes)

### Notes on Proceedings

Workshops that wish to have their proceedings published in the ACM DL will have the opportunity to have either a pre or post proceedings. However, chairs will be responsible for collecting and verifying final copies, including PDFs and their source files, as well as paper metadata, in a format required by the publisher. The deadlines mentioned above are **strict** and we won't be able to extend them. Please consider them carefully when determining your deadlines for the workshop.

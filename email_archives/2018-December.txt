Subject: [Marionet] Call for Extended Abstracts: MoreVMs'19
Message-ID: <6CE6F2E4-C2DA-419E-BBDA-60333DF0B3AD@kent.ac.uk>

============================================================================
                 Call for Extended Abstracts: MoreVMs'19

                             3rd Workshop on
                 Modern Language Runtimes, and Ecosystems

                     Co-located with <Programming>'19
                   April 1st or 2nd, 2019, Genova, Italy

       https://2019.programming-conference.org/track/MoreVMs-2019
============================================================================

Following two previous successful editions, the MoreVMs'19 workshop aims to
bring together industrial and academic programmers to discuss the design,
implementation, and usage of modern languages and runtimes. This includes
aspects such as reuse of language runtimes, modular implementation, language
design and compilation strategies. By bringing together both researchers and
practitioners, the workshop aims to enable a diverse discussion on how
languages and runtimes are currently being utilized, and where they need to
improve further.

Relevant topics include, but are definitely not limited to, the following:

- Extensible VM design (compiler- or interpreter-based VMs)
- Reusable components (e.g. interpreters, garbage collectors, ...)
- Static and dynamic compilation techniques
- Techniques for targeting high-level languages such as JavaScript
- Interoperability between languages
- Tooling support (e.g. debugging, profiling, etc.)
- Programming language development environments
- Case studies of existing language implementation approaches
- Language implementation challenges and trade-offs
- Surveys and usage reports to understand usage in the wild
- Ideas for more predictable performance
- Ideas for how VMs could take advantage of new hardware features
- Ideas for how we should build languages in the future

Workshop Format and Submissions
-------------------------------

We welcome presentation proposals in the form of extended abstracts (1 to 2
pages long) discussing experiences, work-in-progress, as well as future
visions, from either an academic or industrial perspective.

The extended abstracts, and if the speakers wish, their slides, will be
published on the workshop's web site. Alternatively, the abstracts can be
published as part of the companion of <Programming>'19 in the ACM DL.
Publication in the ACM DL is conditional on the acceptance by the program
committee.

Please note that MoreVMs'19 is organized as an academic workshop, and as such,
speakers will be required to register for the workshop.

Author Instructions
-------------------

Submissions should use the ACM Conference 'acmart' Format with the 'sigconf'
option and with a font size of 9 point and the font family Libertine/Biolinum.
All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use
the provided ACM acmart templates. Otherwise, please follow the ACM author
instructions.

If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided
Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your
submission for review using the LaTeX command '\settopmatter{printfolios=true}'
(see examples in template).

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and
white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font
sizes are legible.

Submission Site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=morevms19

Subject: [Marionet] Postdoctoral Position at St Andrews
Message-ID: <F07D96DA-3F03-4139-B1F6-DE941457BF50@kevinhammond.net>

[Please pass on to anyone suitable.  Happy Christmas! Kevin]

The Functional Programming Group seeks a Post Doctoral Research Fellow to work on the recent funded 3-year EU Horizon 2020 Serums project, and the ongoing EU Horizon 2020 TeamPlay project (https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu) <https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu)/>. The TeamPlay project aims to develop new, formally-motivated, techniques that will allow execution time, energy usage, security, and other important non-functional properties of parallel software to be treated effectively, and as first-class citizens. We will build this into a toolbox for developing highly parallel software for low-energy systems, as required by the internet of things, cyber-physical systems etc.

The TeamPlay approach will allow programs to reflect directly on their own time, energy consumption, security, etc., as well as enabling the developer to reason about both the functional and the non-functional properties of their software at the source code level.

The post will require skills in the development and application of lightweight formal methods to non-functional properties, including time, energy and/or security.

Informal enquiries can be directed to Professor Kevin Hammond (kevin at kevinhamond.net <mailto:kevin at kevinhamond.net>). 

The role may be offered on either a full-time or part-time basis, and flexible working may be available to suit the right candidate(s).  More than one appointment may be made, with a suitable division of responsibilities.*Appointment at grade 7 (salary £40,792 - £50,132 per annum) will be considered for candidate with enhanced skills/knowledge of the area with the job description to be amended accordingly. 

Applications are particularly welcome from women and other groups who are under-represented in Computer Science posts at the University.
Please contact Kevin Hammond (kevin at kevinhammond.net <mailto:kevin at kevinhammond.net>) if you would like to discuss the position. 
Deadline for applications is 11/1/19.

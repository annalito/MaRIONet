Message-ID: <ABB8269F-419C-4AE3-B5A8-2E892D2012A4@contoso.com>

Dear Marionet members,

We are delighted to announce that for the current year 2018, Intel and Bayncore are managing a NEW program to support research teams using AI and their scientific papers publishing.

This new program is for current year 2018, and it is highly likely that a similar one will be developed for 2019.

Bayncore is officially in charge of managing the support given to the selected research projects.

Please have a look to the attached overview in PDF.

We will be pleased to answer questions to the teams interested in submitting to this new support program.

We can only insist on the need to react fast as for the 2018 program we need to list the candidates with a description of the project before end of July 2018.

Please contact me or Stephen Blair-Chappell (in copy) as soon as you can.

Kind regards,



Marc DERQUENNES
CEO
Bayncore

Subject: [Marionet] 3 RA/PostDoc positions in Compilers/Runtime at
 University of Edinburgh
Message-ID: <20180606141847.20726vzf28a47txw@www.staffmail.ed.ac.uk>

3 RA/PostDoc positions in compilers/runtime  for  a coarse-grain  
reconfigurable accelerator

University of Edinburgh

Closing date is 5pm GMT on 06 July 2018.


The School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, is advertising  
three research positions in the area of compilers and runtime for a  
coarse-grain reconfigurable accelerator (CGRA).

These posts are associated with SDH, software defined hardware,  a US  
DARPA project led by U. Michigan and in partnership with ARM and U.  
Arizona. The project will tape out a state-of-the art high performance  
CGRA and deliver a compiler and runtime that reconfigures the CGRA  
on-the-fly to changing workloads.

There will be considerable interaction between the sites and for one  
post the candidate will spend a year at U Michigan.

For one post, the ideal candidate will have experience in developing  
light-weight, user-level runtime systems. For the other two posts, the  
ideal candidate will have experience in LLVM based (or similar)  
compiler development. Strong candidates with related relevant  
experience are also encouraged to apply.

Informal enquiries can be addressed to Prof. Michael O?Boyle  
(mob at inf.ed.ac.uk) or Dr Murray Cole (mic at inf.ed.ac.uk) or Dr  
Christophe Dubach (Christophe.Dubach at ed.ac.uk)

The posts are available from 1st August 2018 (the starting date is  
flexible) and are on the UE07 scale (£32,548 - £38,833). The posts  
will be fixed term for 36 months with the possibility of extension to  
48 months depending on funding.

The closing date is 5pm GMT on 06 July 2018.

** **** Overview ****
**
** As processor and system manufacturers increase the amount of
** both inter- and intra-chip parallelism it becomes crucial to
** provide the software industry with high-level, clean and efficient
** tools for parallel programming. Parallel and distributed programming
** methodologies are currently dominated by low-level techniques such
** as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared
** memory mechanisms. Higher-level, structured approaches offer many
** possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable
** exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism. Since 2001 the HLPP series
** of workshops/symposia has been a forum for researchers developing
** state-of-the-art concepts, tools and applications for high-level
** parallel programming. The general emphasis is on software quality,
** programming productivity and high-level performance models.

Pervasive and UbiComp workshop in Cardiff, 14-15 March
-----------------------

The EPSRC-sponsored Pervasive And Ubiquitous Computing Challenge
Workshop is running in Cardiff later this week, 14-15 March 2018, with
the objectives to strengthen and focus UK research activity in
this area. MaRIONet will be well represented at this event. If
you want us to raise any issues and lobby on behalf of the
manycore community, please contact jeremy.singer at glasgow.ac.uk
directly.  More details at

MaRIONet workshop in Belfast, 5 April
-------------------

The ISPASS conference is hosted at Queen's University Belfast -
see http://ispass.org/ispass2018/ for details. A MaRIONet
workshop is running at Queen's the day afterwards, on Thu 5
April. Our plan is to spend time drawing up a list of Grand
Challenges for manycore research, with the aim of producing a
technical report to present to funding agencies. This workshop is
an free, open event - please attend if you are available. Sign up
via doodle at https://doodle.com/poll/6a6swhxxpwin62ft and start
thinking about your grand challenge proposal. We will set up
online access to the workshop, via Google hangouts or similar,
for network members who cannot attend in person.

Summer school in Glasgow, 16-20 July - save the date.
-------------------

The Manycore Summer School will be held in Glasgow, Mon 16 to Fri
20 July 2018. We have an exciting lineup of speakers, including
researchers from Arm, Oracle, and Women in HPC, along with
academics from Southampton, Bristol, Belfast and Princeton. The
sign-up page will go live very soon - please encourage your PhD
students to come along!  UK-based PhD students will be granted
free registration and accommodation for the week, on a
first-come-first-served basis.


-----------------------
Network stats
-----------------------

We now have around 120 members on our mailing list, from a range
of industry and academic partners. This exceeds our original
target by some way, and we are still growing! Please encourage
your manycore collaborators to join our network too. Ask them to
mail natascha.hart at glasgow.ac.uk to subscribe to this low-traffic
list.

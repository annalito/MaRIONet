Network coordinator Jeremy Singer writes:

Final opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to sign up for the
Manycore Summer School in Glasgow.

A range of speakers from academia and industry will be giving talks
and hands-on lab sessions. We have a few free places remaining for
students from UK universities. The event runs 16-20 July 2018 (week
after ACACES/HiPEAC). Participants only have to fund their own travel
to Glasgow - we are providing free accommodation, courtesy of
sponsorship from EPSRC and SICSA. This is the flagship event of the
Manycore network.

The 11th edition of PLACES (Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software) will be co-located with ETAPS 2019 in Prague, Czech Republic on 7th April 2019.

Workshop website: https://conf.researchr.org/track/etaps-2019/places-2019-papers

For over a decade, PLACES has been a popular forum for researchers from different fields to exchange new ideas about challenges to modern and future programming, where concurrency and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern.

Submissions are invited in the general area of programming language approaches to concurrency, communication, and distribution, ranging from foundational issues, through language implementations, to applications and case studies. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by a minimum of three reviewers, with the aim of allocating at least one expert reviewer. Papers are reviewed based on their novelty, clarity, and technical soundness. Submission must not be submitted elsewhere and must be formatted in EPTCS format, containing a maximum of 8 pages (with no restriction on bibliography or appendices, which the reviewers need not read). The proceedings of PLACES 2019 will be published as a volume of EPTCS.

Key dates:
- Submission deadline: 24th January 2019 (AoE)
- Author notification: 21st February 2019
- Camera ready: 7th March 2019
- Workshop: 7th April 2019
- ETAPS: 6th-11th April 2019

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

- Design and implementation of programming languages with first class concurrency and communication
- Models, such as process algebra and automata
- Behavioural types, including session types
- Concurrent data types, objects and actors
- Verification and program analysis methods for concurrent and distributed software
- Memory models for concurrent programming on relaxed-memory architectures
- Interface languages for communication and distribution
- Applications in web services, sensor networks, scientific computing, HPC.
- Concurrency and communication in event processing and business process management

Chairs for 2019:
- Francisco Martins (University of the Azores)
- Dominic Orchard (University of Kent)

Programme Commitee:
- Tiago Cogumbreiro (University of Massachusetts Boston)
- Ornela Dardha (University of Glasgow)
- Simon Fowler (University of Edinburgh)
- Adrian Francalanza (University of Malta)
- Hai Liu (DFINITY)
- Michele Loreti (University of Florence)

Subject: [Marionet] Two academic positions at the University of Manchester
Message-ID: <9FFFA40598AB3B419940910DA0021D3ED7381025@MBXP02.ds.man.ac.uk>

Dear colleagues,

The School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester invites application for two full-time faculty member at the Lecturer level. The School is further strengthening its presence in innovative computer architectures and systems, both in the fundamentals of the discipline and its application in a variety of areas.

Applications are welcomed from any branch of Computer Engineering, Architecture, Reconfigurable Computing, Networks, and Systems, though we are particularly seeking to make one appointment in the area of neuromorphic-computing; to complement the SpiNNaker team in the EU Human Brain Project.

Deadline Nov 30, 2018

Further information and how to apply: https://www.jobs.manchester.ac.uk/displayjob.aspx?jobid=16334

Best regards,

Prof Mikel Lujan

Subject: [Marionet] Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellowship at the University
	of Manchester
Message-ID: <9FFFA40598AB3B419940910DA0021D3ED73810B0@MBXP02.ds.man.ac.uk>

Dear colleagues,

The flagship Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Research Fellowships are aimed at outstanding scientists and engineers at an early stage in their academic careers. Fellows should show a high level of creativity and ambition in their ideas and want to develop potentially transformative research. We anticipate up to 12 of these prestigious Fellowships to be offered annually. Each Fellowship is for an initial 5 year period, leading to full academic tenure on completion, subject to performance and probation.

Applications in the School of Computer Science at The University of Manchester are welcomed from any branch of Neuromorphic computing, Robots/Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Computer Engineering, Architecture, Reconfigurable Computing, Networks, Compilers and Runtime Systems, Quantum Accelerators and Computer Security. Fellowship proposals need to be seeking to do exciting, disruptive, transformatory research.

Deadline: 23 Nov, 2018

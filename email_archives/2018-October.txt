Subject: [Marionet] [Vacancy] Research Assistant/Research Associate in
 Compiler Engineering at University of Edinburgh
Message-ID: <20181022110437.20241xk10mh971lw@www.staffmail.ed.ac.uk>

Applications are invited for the position of Research  
Assistant/Research Associate on the EPSRC funded project Discovery:  
Pattern Discovery and Program shaping for Heterogeneous Manycore  
Systems. This project is a collaboration between the Universities of  
Edinburgh and St Andrews, investigating new compiler based approaches  
to restructuring legacy sequential and parallel C++ applications to  
ease the introduction and tuning of skeleton-based patterned  
parallelism.

This post will involve working with the LLVM compiler framework, to  
encode definitions of the relevant code patterns as compiler passes,  
and to communicate the findings of these passes to the team members  
who are working on code-refactoring tools. There will be opportunities  
to take responsibility for guiding research decisions and for  
collaborating on research papers, all within the freedom of an  
academic research environment. The post would be suitable for a  
flexible working pattern, e.g. working largely remotely, and will  
offer opportunities for travel.

for more details.


The post is full time, fixed-term and is available from 1st January  
2019 to 30th June 2020.

Informal enquiries can be addressed to Prof. Murray Cole  
(mic at inf.ed.ac.uk) or Dr Bjoern Franke (bfranke at inf.ed.ac.uk).

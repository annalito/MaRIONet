Subject: [Marionet] Tornado heterogeneous programming framework public
	release v0.1
Message-ID: <214A01D3-AEA9-4632-B1E0-AEA6E8A6D2CC@manchester.ac.uk>

Dear all,

We are happy to announce the open sourcing of Tornado, a practical heterogeneous programming framework for Java.

Tornado enables JIT compilation and acceleration of Java code on any OpenCL compatible devices including GPUs and in the future FPGAs.
Our recent publication in ManLang 2018 describes in detail the internals of Tornado and its capabilities: http://goo.gl/78nhje

Thanks to EPSRC, Tornado started as the PhD thesis of James Clarkson under the joint supervision of Mikel Lujan and continues growing under the EU H2020 E2Data<https://e2data.eu> and ACTiCLOUD<https://acticloud.eu> grants.

On behalf of our team members - James Clarkson, Juan Fumero, Foivos Zakkak, Michalis Papadimitriou, Mary Xekalaki, and Mikel Lujan - please checkout Tornado and start accelerating your applications!

We look forward to hearing your feedback and success stories!

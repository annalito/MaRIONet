Subject: [Marionet] Call for Proposal: Sheffield GPU Hackathon 2019
Message-ID: <CAB+JX=g9Gg4s1DzhBySy7dkgwX9wb=phRsFtjF_KWwuTXpXgQQ@mail.gmail.com>

The University of Sheffield is pleased to announce that the GPU Hackathon
in the UK (sponsored by Nvidia) will be held at the Halifax Hall, in
Sheffield, United Kingdom.

=================================================================
August 19-23 2019 â€” Sheffield, United Kingdom

Call for proposals

http://gpuhack.shef.ac.uk/
=================================================================

We are looking for teams of 3-5 developers with a scalable** application to
port to or optimize on a GPU accelerator. Collectively the team must have
complete knowledge of the application. If the application is a suite of
apps, no more than two per team will be allowed and a minimum of 2 people
per app must attend. Space will be limited to 8 teams.

** node-to-node communication implemented, but donâ€™t be discouraged from
applying if your application is less than scalable. We are also looking for
breadth of application areas.

The goal of the GPU hackathon is for current or prospective user groups of
large hybrid CPU-GPU systems to send teams of at least 3 developers along
with either:

- A (potentially) scalable application that could benefit from GPU
accelerators, or
- An application running on accelerators that needs optimization.

There will be intensive mentoring during this 5-day hands-on workshop, with
the goal that the teams leave with applications running on GPUs, or at
least with a clear roadmap of how to get there.


Full details on submissions are available here: http://gpuhack.shef.ac.uk/

          The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming


                 Call for Papers for Volume 4, Issue 2

                 http://programming-journal.org/cfp/
                       Follow us @programmingconf
========================================================================

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming was created with the
goal of placing the wonderful art of programming on the map of scholarly
works. Many academic journals and conferences exist that publish research
related to programming, starting with programming languages, software
engineering, and expanding to the whole Computer Science field. Yet, many
of us feel that, as the field of Computer Science expanded, programming,
in itself, has been neglected to a secondary role not worthy of scholarly
attention. That is a serious gap, as much of the progress in Computer
Science lies on the basis of computer programs, the people who write
Them, and the concepts and tools available to them to express
computational tasks.

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming aims at closing this
gap by focusing primarily on programming: the art itself (programming
styles, pearls, models, languages), the emerging science of understanding
what works and what doesnâ€™t work in general and in specific contexts,
as well as more established engineering and mathematical perspectives.


We solicit papers describing work from one of the following perspectives:

  Art: knowledge and technical skills acquired through practice and
       personal experiences. Examples include libraries, frameworks,
       languages, APIs, programming models and styles, programming
       pearls, and essays about programming.

  Science (Theoretical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through mathematical formalisms. Examples include formal
       programming models and proofs.

  Science (Empirical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through experiments and systematic observations. Examples
       include user studies and programming-related data mining.

  Engineering: knowledge and technical skills acquired through
       designing and building large systems and through calculated
       application of principles in building those systems.
       Examples include measurements of artifactsâ€™ properties,
       development processes and tools, and quality assurance methods.

Independent of the type of work, the journal accepts submissions covering several areas of expertise, including but not limited to:

 - General-purpose programming
 - Data mining and machine learning programming, and for programming
 - Database programming
 - Distributed systems programming
 - Graphics and GPU programming
 - Interpreters, virtual machines, and compilers
 - Metaprogramming and reflection
 - Model-based development
 - Modularity and separation of concerns
 - Parallel and multi-core programming
 - Program verification
 - Programming education
 - Programming environments
 - Security programming
 - Social coding
 - Testing and debugging
 - User interface programming
 - Visual and live programming

All details, including the selection process are described on
  http://programming-journal.org/cfp/

Details on the submission processed are available at
  http://programming-journal.org/submission/

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present at the
<Programming>â€™20 conference in Porto, Portugal from March 23-26:
  https://2020.programming-conference.org/


## Upcoming Deadlines

We solicit submissions for the following upcoming deadlines:

Submission:           June 1
First notification:   August 1
Revised submission:   September 1
Final notification:   September 7
Camera-ready:         September 15

Fully funded PhD studentship in â€œFull-System Simulation of Mobile GPU Graphicsâ€




One fully funded PhD position to work with Dr BjÃ¶rn Franke in the School of Informatics at the University, on a project titled â€œFull-System Simulation of Mobile GPU Graphicsâ€.




Overview of the Project




The project is concerned with simulation technology targeting mobile GPUs, and especially their graphics related capabilities. Research in this area has been focussing mainly on the GPU compute capabilities (â€œGeneral-purpose GPU â€œGPGPUâ€), for compute kernels written in OpenCL or CUDA. In this project we are focussing on the detailed simulation of 3D graphics functionality of mobile GPUs. Together with industry partner ARM, we will be working on full system simulation of their latest mobile GPU technology studying how to improve up simulation performance while at the same time providing detailed insights into the GPU operation and accurate modelling of its behaviour. If successful, this research has the potential to deliver significant impact within the academic research community as well as to industry.




Candidateâ€™s Profile




- A good Bachelors degree (2.1 or equivalent) in a relevant subject (Informatics, Computer Science, or closely related subject)

- Strong programming skills in C/C++ and assembly

- Proficiency in English (both oral and written)

- Knowledge of one or more among computer architecture/design, computer graphics, and parallel programming is highly desirable.

- Enthusiasm in the entire computer graphics software and hardware stack!




Studentship and Eligibility




The studentship covers:




- Full time PhD tuition fees for a student with UK/EU nationality (Â£4,327 per annum, subject to annual increment).

- A tax free stipend of GBP Â£15,009 per year for 3 years.

- Additional programme costs of Â£1000 per year.




Application Information




Applicants should contact Dr BjÃ¶rn Franke (bfranke at inf.ed.ac.uk
) immediately.Â

                 Call for Papers for Volume 4, Issue 3

========================================================================

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming was created with the
goal of placing the wonderful art of programming on the map of scholarly
works. Many academic journals and conferences exist that publish research
related to programming, starting with programming languages, software
engineering, and expanding to the whole Computer Science field. Yet, many
of us feel that, as the field of Computer Science expanded, programming,
in itself, has been neglected to a secondary role not worthy of scholarly
attention. That is a serious gap, as much of the progress in Computer
Science lies on the basis of computer programs, the people who write them,
and the concepts and tools available to them to express computational tasks.

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming aims at closing this
gap by focusing primarily on programming: the art itself (programming
styles, pearls, models, languages), the emerging science of understanding
what works and what doesnâ€™t work in general and in specific contexts,
as well as more established engineering and mathematical perspectives.


We solicit papers describing work from one of the following perspectives:

  Art: knowledge and technical skills acquired through practice and
       personal experiences. Examples include libraries, frameworks,
       languages, APIs, programming models and styles, programming
       pearls, and essays about programming.

  Science (Theoretical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through mathematical formalisms. Examples include formal
       programming models and proofs.

  Science (Empirical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through experiments and systematic observations. Examples
       include user studies and programming-related data mining.

  Engineering: knowledge and technical skills acquired through
       designing and building large systems and through calculated
       application of principles in building those systems.
       Examples include measurements of artifactsâ€™ properties,
       development processes and tools, and quality assurance methods.

Independent of the type of work, the journal accepts submissions covering
several areas of expertise, including but not limited to:

 - General-purpose programming
 - Data mining and machine learning programming, and for programming
 - Database programming
 - Distributed systems programming
 - Graphics and GPU programming
 - Interpreters, virtual machines, and compilers
 - Metaprogramming and reflection
 - Model-based development
 - Modularity and separation of concerns
 - Parallel and multi-core programming
 - Program verification
 - Programming education
 - Programming environments
 - Security programming
 - Social coding
 - Testing and debugging
 - User interface programming
 - Visual and live programming

All details, including the selection process are described on
  http://programming-journal.org/cfp/

Details on the submission processed are available at
  http://programming-journal.org/submission/

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present at the
<Programming>â€™20 conference in Porto, Portugal from March 23-26:
  https://2020.programming-conference.org/

We solicit submissions for the following upcoming deadlines:

Submission:           October 1
First notification:   December 1
Revised submission:   January 1
Final notification:   January 7

Subject: [Spls] Jobs: Assistant Professor in Computer Science (Teaching Fellow) @ Heriot-Watt Univ

Dear All,

At the Computer Science Dept of Heriot-Watt Univ we are advertising for an Assistant Professor with expertise in computer systems, to cover our teaching areas such as
computer architecture, hardware-software interface, OS, networking, low-level programming languages, high-performance computing, etc.

Additional expertise in formal methods and verification is desirable and would link well with the research activities of the dependable systems group (DSG)
in the department.

This is a teaching & scholarship position with a focus on teaching and related administrative duties. Here is the link to the advertisement:

https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/BTX560/

The closing date for applications is 20th August 2019.

This is a one-year term position that would start as early as September (this is negotiable).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact "Just, Mike" <M.Just at hw.ac.uk> or "Loidl, Hans-Wolfgang" <H.W.Loidl at hw.ac.uk> directly.

# Manycore Newsletter #7 - Aug 2019

## Events

The UK Manycore Network sponsored a couple of events over the summer months. These included the Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School at Strathclyde University on 5â€“9 August. Topics covered were Probabilistic programming, Agda, Category theory, Session types, Domain specific languages and Parallel programming. Slides, photos and other resources are up at http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/splv/splv19
This was the first summer school in the series, but the organisers intend to run future events annually.

The network also sponsored the 2nd UK OpenMP Users Conference at EPCC in Edinburgh on June 4-5. More details about the event are archived at https://ukopenmpusers.co.uk

If you would like to host a manycore themed research workshop, please get in touch with Jeremy.Singer at glasgow.ac.uk soon (i.e. before we run out of event sponsorship money!)

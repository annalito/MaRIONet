          The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming


              Call for Papers for Volume 4, Issue 1 & 2

========================================================================

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming was created with the
goal of placing the wonderful art of programming on the map of scholarly
works. Many academic journals and conferences exist that publish research
related to programming, starting with programming languages, software
engineering, and expanding to the whole Computer Science field. Yet, many
of us feel that, as the field of Computer Science expanded, programming,
in itself, has been neglected to a secondary role not worthy of scholarly
attention. That is a serious gap, as much of the progress in Computer
Science lies on the basis of computer programs, the people who write
Them, and the concepts and tools available to them to express
computational tasks.

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming aims at closing this
gap by focusing primarily on programming: the art itself (programming
styles, pearls, models, languages), the emerging science of understanding
what works and what doesn’t work in general and in specific contexts,
as well as more established engineering and mathematical perspectives.


We solicit papers describing work from one of the following perspectives:

  Art: knowledge and technical skills acquired through practice and
       personal experiences. Examples include libraries, frameworks,
       languages, APIs, programming models and styles, programming
       pearls, and essays about programming.

  Science (Theoretical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through mathematical formalisms. Examples include formal
       programming models and proofs.

  Science (Empirical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through experiments and systematic observations. Examples
       include user studies and programming-related data mining.

  Engineering: knowledge and technical skills acquired through
       designing and building large systems and through calculated
       application of principles in building those systems.
       Examples include measurements of artifacts’ properties,
       development processes and tools, and quality assurance methods.

Independent of the type of work, the journal accepts submissions covering several areas of expertise, including but not limited to:

 - General-purpose programming
 - Data mining and machine learning programming, and for programming
 - Database programming
 - Distributed systems programming
 - Graphics and GPU programming
 - Interpreters, virtual machines, and compilers
 - Metaprogramming and reflection
 - Model-based development
 - Modularity and separation of concerns
 - Parallel and multi-core programming
 - Program verification
 - Programming education
 - Programming environments
 - Security programming
 - Social coding
 - Testing and debugging
 - User interface programming
 - Visual and live programming

All details, including the selection process are described on
  http://programming-journal.org/cfp/

Details on the submission processed are available at
  http://programming-journal.org/submission/

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present at the
<Programming>’20 conference in early 2020. Further details will be
announced in April 2019 at <Programming>’19:

Subject: [Marionet] WHPC@ISC'19 Call for participation and posters
Message-ID: <CAB+JX=gMdfMDbq_Ws-shHV3fW97Q1YepPTtUpYiWSN7XDQBO8A@mail.gmail.com>

Call for early/mid career posters on HPC topics for the 10th International
Women in HPC Workshop

=================================================================
10th International Women in HPC workshop
Thursday June 20th 2019 — Frankfurt, Germany

Call for posters and participation

https://womeninhpc.org/whpc-isc19/workshop/
=================================================================

The tenth international Women in HPC workshop will discuss methods to
improve diversity and provide early career women with the opportunity to
develop their professional skills and profile. The workshop will include:

- Becoming an advocate and ally of under-represented women
- Putting in place a framework to help women take leadership positions
- Building mentoring programmes that work effectively for women.
- Posters and lightning talks by women working in HPC
- Short talks on: dealing with poor behaviour at work and how to help avoid
it getting you down, how to deal with negative feedback, how to build
writing into your daily routine and why it matters, etc.


Call for posters: Now Open!
Deadline for submissions: March 4th 2019 AOE

As part of the workshop, we invite submissions from women in industry and
academia to present their work as a poster. Submissions are invited on all
topics relating to HPC from users and developers. All abstracts should
emphasize the computational aspects of the work, such as the facilities
used, the challenges that HPC can help address and any remaining challenges
etc.

Exclusive to WHPC at ISC19: Successful authors will have the opportunity to
present their poster in the main ISC19 conference poster session.

For full details please see:

Subject: [Marionet] Fully funded PhD position on Protocol Synthesis
Message-ID: <CAMYczZc8b1EP=t4JNggMM1_enzkE_iPFm87gesq++Tcs2_u3ww@mail.gmail.com>

Concurrent and distributed protocols (e.g. cache coherence protocols) are
notoriously hard to get right or scale. Can we use program synthesis
techniques to synthesise correct-by-construction and high-performance
protocols?

This position is suited for a motivated researcher with strong coding
skills, a strong undergraduate (or postgraduate) degree, and expertise in
one or more of the following areas:

-computer architecture

-verification

-programming languages.

-distributed systems

-concurrency

This is a fully funded PhD position with no restrictions on nationality.

Please contact Dr. Vijay Nagarajan (vijay.nagarajan at ed.ac.uk) for more
information.

PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel
programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages,
compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the
context of the symposium, â€œparallel programmingâ€ encompasses work on
concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded,
heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; data
centers; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel
architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile
devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work
that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of
extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques
and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or
work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.
Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Compilers and runtime systems for parallel and heterogeneous systems
* Concurrent data structures
* Development, analysis, or management tools
* Fault tolerance for parallel systems
* Formal analysis and verification
* High-performance / scientific computing
* Libraries
* Middleware for parallel systems
* Parallel algorithms
* Parallel applications and frameworks
* Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including
nonvolatile memory
* Parallel programming languages
* Parallel programming theory and models
* Parallelism in non-scientific workloads: web, search,
analytics, cloud, machine learning
* Performance analysis, debugging and optimization
* Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems
* Software engineering for parallel programs
* Software for heterogeneous architectures
* Software productivity for parallel programming
* Synchronization and concurrency control

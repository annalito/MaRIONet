# Manycore Newsletter #8 - Nov 2019

## Manycore network funding extended

Brexit wasn't the only thing delayed past 31 Oct ... the UK
Manycore Network funding from EPSRC was also due to finish on 31
Oct. However we are delighted to announce we have received an
extension till 31 March 2020 - which will allow us to run some
more workshops and publish our final report next year.

## EPSRC calls

There are several highly relevant activities taking place at the
moment. The Digital Security by Design challenge aims to increase
the protection of software in the light of increased cyber-attack
against various class of software vulnerabilities, through
additional hardware protection capabilities architected around
the containment of pointers, and the privilege by which regions
of fine grain data can be accessed. See
https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/iscf-digital-security-by-design-research-projects/
for full details. Info workshop in London on 22 Nov. Outline
proposal deadline on 7 Jan.

The Trustworthy Autonomous Systems iniative is well
underway. EPSRC hosted a town-hall style workshop in October. An
call for outline proposals for a Trustworthy Autonomous Systems
hub is now live, closing date 12 Dec. See
https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/trustworthy-autonomous-systems-hub-outline-call/
for details. A further funding call is due to be announced soon.

## Research workshops

We supported the Scottish Programming Languages Seminar in
Glasgow on 30 Oct - see
https://spls-series.github.io/meetings/2019/october/ for
details. Over 60 researchers enjoyed a keynote talk from James
Noble (New Zealand) who described how "programs don't just
simulate the real world, but rise from the abyss replace it."
Other hot topics included Session Types, Dependent Types and APL.

We have significant amounts of funding left to support further
academic workshops. We can pay for keynote speaker travel,
catering and room hire for events. Please get in touch with
d.jacob.1 at research.gla.ac.uk to apply for network funding to host
an event.

> Hello,
> 
> I am writing to invite you to a joint UK Computing Research Committee and EPSRC workshop on the 6th December in Edinburgh. 
> 
> The aims of the workshop are to:
> *	Develop a strategy to rejuvenate and focus UK Computing Research for the next 5-10 years
> *	Identify key technical and societal challenges that computing researchers can address in partnership with the EPSRC and lead government departments
> 
> The workshop programme will run from 9:45 - 16:00 and will include:
> *	Talks from researchers from non-computing domains, discussing the challenges they face and identifying opportunities for how the computing research community could help overcome these challenges.
> *	Formation of exciting, adventurous research ideas which could transform the computing research landscape with a view to development for EPSRC's Big Ideas initiative.
> *	A presentation on consultations, outlining how you can effectively contribute to getting the voice of the computing research community heard.
> *	Discussion on regulation - raising awareness and understanding of what regulation means in the computing research community, now and in the future.
> *	The UKCRC AGM will be incorporated into the event, and will include discussion on the mission of UKCRC as well as an update on work streams.
> 
> Non-members of UKCRC and early career researchers are strongly encouraged to attend, as a diverse pool of attendees is desired.

* Call for Brief Announcements

PPoPP 2020: 25th ACM SIGPLAN Annual Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Parallel Programming

San Diego, California, USA. (collocated with HPCA-2020 and CGO-2020) Dates:
Sat 22 - Wed 26 February 2020.

Conference URL: https://ppopp20.sigplan.org

Submission URL: https://ppopp20posters.hotcrp.com

** Important dates

* Brief Announcement Submission: November 1, 2019
* Author Notification: December 2, 2019
* Final Version Due: January 6, 2020

All deadlines are at midnight anywhere on earth (AoE), and are firm.

** Scope

PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel
programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages,
compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience.  PPoPP Brief
Announcements are expected to discuss thought-provoking research that is
not yet mature enough for publication as a full paper.  The specific topics
of interest for PPoPP Brief Announcements include, but are not limited to,
those listed for the main conference (see
https://ppopp20.sigplan.org/track/PPoPP-2020 papers#Call-for-Papers).

** Brief Announcement Submission

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference web
site. Submissions should be no more than 2 pages, including references,
using the SIGPLAN proceedings template.  Appendices are not allowed, but
the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source
code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at
supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.  Accepted
Brief Announcements will appear in the PPOPP proceedings.  Please note that
publishing a Brief Announcement does not prevent an author from publishing
a full manuscript on the same topic at a later time.

Submission is double blind and authors will need to identify any potential
conflicts of interest with the Brief Announcement Program Committee, as
defined in the ACM SIGPLAN policy at
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/.  Submissions should not
reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out
author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They
should also ensure that any references to authors' own related work should
be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but
rather "We build on the work of ...").  The purpose of this process is to
help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the
paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the
authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of
anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the
paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should
not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to
disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally
would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or
give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on
double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.

Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper.
Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until
the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be
the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, that
deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be
rejected.

** Publication Date

The titles of all accepted Brief Announcements are typically announced
shortly after the author notification date. Note, however, that this is not
the official publication date. The official publication date is the date
the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will
make the proceedings available via the Digital Library for one month, up to
2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

** Presentation and Poster Session Details

At least one author of each Brief Announcement must register for and attend
the conference.  Each accepted Brief Announcement will be expected to give
a short  presentation of their work (length TBD) during the conference, and
also to present a poster during the PPoPP research poster session.

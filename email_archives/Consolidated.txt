Hi network members,

We want to run our MaRIONet launch meeting in London early 2017. Please fill in the doodle poll below to indicate when you are free to attend this event. At the launch meeting we will introduce the manycore network, outline the schedule of activities, and run the first industrial/academic "speed dating" session. We also hope to have a "New Cross-ICT Priorities" overview from the EPSRC ICT team.

Please doodle at http://doodle.com/poll/p2crvxhc6q5shecs

Many thanks,
Jeremy

Reliable, Secure and Scalable Software Systems (RS4) Workshop

1st September  2017

Call for Presentations and Participation

http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/gpg/RS4/


<http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/gpg/RS4/>

The era of many-core computing is transforming much of computing and areas like AI, sensor nets, IoT, and big data are just some examples. Many-core software systems have three main components: computation, i.e. the algorithms to be performed, data encoded in data structures and data stores, and communication between compute units:

  Software Systems = Computation + Data + Communication


Such systems must resolve three inter-linked challenges in each of the components to be:

  *   Scalable: emergent computing platforms operate at unprecedented scale, with commodity servers already commonly comprising hundreds of hosts, tens of thousands of cores, and thousands of storage devices.
  *   Reliable: systems must tolerate and recover from hardware, software and network failures.
  *   Secure: Systems are increasingly connected, and hence vulnerable to misuse and attack.

RS4 is a 1 day workshop that brings together academic and industrial researchers to outline both challenges and promising approaches.


The workshop is sponsored by SICSA <https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/&sa=D&ust=1493737890000000&usg=AFQjCNHCGsvuCaQk7g-PjajuAhWW3BdX-Q> http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/&sa=D&ust=1493737890001000&usg=AFQjCNFfbwTh1FhPb1oEEQEpaA61CEoNPQ>  and the EPSRC <https://www.google.com/url?q=http://manycore.org.uk&sa=D&ust=1493737890002000&usg=AFQjCNGgwtzVA-KSwnnQCH0kr23uo95iiA> MaRIONet<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://manycore.org.uk&sa=D&ust=1493737890002000&usg=AFQjCNGgwtzVA-KSwnnQCH0kr23uo95iiA> Manycore Network, and is part of the 60<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890003000&usg=AFQjCNHrCEY868HNi7uT6aexjhi6JTWe-g>th<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890004000&usg=AFQjCNFXeCqjZm2I1qBfRBI2GETA_SnkDA> anniversary of the School of Computing Science, at the University of Glasgow<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/&sa=D&ust=1493737890005000&usg=AFQjCNEBxMr2R9MRn793ll3oZfNzW2VlPw>

Folks,

We had a very productive workshop in Glasgow on the 1st September with 7 talks and some plenary discussion. It was attended by some 50 people with a good mix of industrial and academic speakers and participants. There were presentations from high profile industrialists: Alastair Reid (ARM), Alastair Murray (Codeplay Software), Michele Weiland (EPCC), David Irvine (Maidsafe) and Tony Printezis (Twitter), and participation from leading universities: including Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Heriot-Watt.

We discussed the challenges of engineering reliable scalable and secure software (RS4) for emergent platforms, and some possible approaches to solving them.

Attached is a summary of the workshop, and the full materials, including most sets of presentation slides are available from the workshop pages:

Hi All:

We are delighted to announce the next lecture from the FST Research Colloquia series, which will take place from 1:00 pm in the Pavilion (C1.18), 115 New Cavendish Street on Friday 27 October.
https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-locations/maps-and-directions/cavendish

The seminar, hosted by the Distributed and Intelligent Systems Research Group, will feature a distinguished speaker - Professor Soumitra K. Nandy (Indian Institute of Science Bangalore) - on "Reconfigurable Many-Core Architecture of a Supercomputing System-on-Chip" (details below). Please do come along if you are able to - all welcome.

Kind regards,

Vladimir Getov

Abstract: Many-core architectures are projected as the vehicle to extend the computing performance of a processor within a power envelope. Achieving hardware scalability and performance are the primary challenges in building a many-core processor, especially when such a processor is to be realized as a SoC. There is a growing consensus that dataflow based execution models can improve productivity and performance of many-core architectures. Dataflow based execution models are attractive for their deterministic behaviour and ability to express arbitrary parallelism. REDEFINE from Morphing Machines is a massively parallel, runtime reconfigurable many-core processor that supports the dataflow model of execution. With REDEFINE as a case in point, we will discuss how arbitrary parallelism is exploited in REDEFINE through hardware-defined programming. In conclusion, we will play a recording of concurrent application kernels running on a 256 Compute Element REDEFINE emulated on 6 Virtex 7 2000T FPGA devices.

Short Bio: Soumitra K. Nandy holds the position of a Senior Professor in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISB). He graduated from I.I.T. Kharagpur in 1974 with a B.Sc. (Honours) degree in Physics, and then obtained his B.E. (Honours) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 1980, M.Sc.(Eng.) degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 1986, and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 1989, all from IISB. Prof. S. K. Nandy was instrumental in setting up a state-of-the-art laboratory for Computer Aided Design at the institute in 1983 with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of India. This laboratory has active collaborations with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, The Netherlands, Tokyo University and Waseda University, Japan, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Nowadays, the laboratory is engaged in state-of-the-art research in Reconfigurable System-on-Chip architectures for next generation desktop supercomputing platforms. Over the years, he has graduated 20 PhD, and over 100 Master students who have worked for their theses in the laboratory. His current research addresses important issues in micro-architectural and compiler optimizations for power and performance in Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), and Runtime Reconfigurable SoCs. All his research targets massively parallel architectures and platforms for accelerating computations for Next Generation Sequence Alignment, Numerical Linear Algebra, Real-time Face Recognition, Cognition Engines, Genomics, and Molecular Dynamics. Prof. Nandy has over 175 research publications in International Journals and Proceedings of International Conferences that highlight his research contributions, and 5 patents to his credit.

The EPSRC-sponsored Pervasive And Ubiquitous Computing Challenge
Workshop is running in Cardiff later this week, 14-15 March 2018, with
the objectives to strengthen and focus UK research activity in
this area. MaRIONet will be well represented at this event. If
you want us to raise any issues and lobby on behalf of the
manycore community, please contact jeremy.singer at glasgow.ac.uk
directly.  More details at
https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/puccommunityworkshopeoi/

MaRIONet workshop in Belfast, 5 April
-------------------

The ISPASS conference is hosted at Queen's University Belfast -
see http://ispass.org/ispass2018/ for details. A MaRIONet
workshop is running at Queen's the day afterwards, on Thu 5
April. Our plan is to spend time drawing up a list of Grand
Challenges for manycore research, with the aim of producing a
technical report to present to funding agencies. This workshop is
an free, open event - please attend if you are available. Sign up
via doodle at https://doodle.com/poll/6a6swhxxpwin62ft and start
thinking about your grand challenge proposal. We will set up
online access to the workshop, via Google hangouts or similar,
for network members who cannot attend in person.


-------------------
Summer school in Glasgow, 16-20 July - save the date.
-------------------

The Manycore Summer School will be held in Glasgow, Mon 16 to Fri
20 July 2018. We have an exciting lineup of speakers, including
researchers from Arm, Oracle, and Women in HPC, along with
academics from Southampton, Bristol, Belfast and Princeton. The
sign-up page will go live very soon - please encourage your PhD
students to come along!  UK-based PhD students will be granted
free registration and accommodation for the week, on a
first-come-first-served basis.


-----------------------
Network stats
-----------------------

We now have around 120 members on our mailing list, from a range
of industry and academic partners. This exceeds our original
target by some way, and we are still growing! Please encourage
your manycore collaborators to join our network too. Ask them to
mail natascha.hart at glasgow.ac.uk to subscribe to this low-traffic
list.

Hi all,

Tomorrow (Thu 5 Apr) we are convening a Manycore Network Grand Challenges workshop in Belfast, 10am-3pm. Please join this meeting remotely if you are available for some/all of the time. We will post a Google Hangouts link on this mailing list tomorrow morning.

Agenda:

10-11: Deconstructing Grand Challenges.
What is a grand challenge, or moonshot? Why do we need them? We review similar exercises in the past, and highlight successes and failures.

11-12: Discussion about Manycore Grand Challenges.
We aim to construct a list of 10 to 20 challenges, which will be whittled down through the day. These are research problems / real-world challenges that we want the manycore community to address. Bring Your Own Challenge!

12-1230: Discussion about Grand Challenge Activities.
Should we run hackathons? Workshops? Curate an interactive website? Publish a journal special issue?

1230-1330: lunch

1330-1400: Interactive Voting Exercise
We aim to identify the top N grand challenges.

14-15: Moving Forward.
Discussion about timeline for activities, champions for grand challenges. Strategy for community engagement.



Hope you can join us for some of these sessions online. We will post the google hangouts link tomorrow, before we start at 10.

Many thanks,

3 RA/PostDoc positions in compilers/runtime  for  a coarse-grain  
reconfigurable accelerator

University of Edinburgh

Closing date is 5pm GMT on 06 July 2018.


The School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, is advertising  
three research positions in the area of compilers and runtime for a  
coarse-grain reconfigurable accelerator (CGRA).

These posts are associated with SDH, software defined hardware,  a US  
DARPA project led by U. Michigan and in partnership with ARM and U.  
Arizona. The project will tape out a state-of-the art high performance  
CGRA and deliver a compiler and runtime that reconfigures the CGRA  
on-the-fly to changing workloads.

There will be considerable interaction between the sites and for one  
post the candidate will spend a year at U Michigan.

For one post, the ideal candidate will have experience in developing  
light-weight, user-level runtime systems. For the other two posts, the  
ideal candidate will have experience in LLVM based (or similar)  
compiler development. Strong candidates with related relevant  
experience are also encouraged to apply.

Informal enquiries can be addressed to Prof. Michael O?Boyle  
(mob at inf.ed.ac.uk) or Dr Murray Cole (mic at inf.ed.ac.uk) or Dr  
Christophe Dubach (Christophe.Dubach at ed.ac.uk)

The posts are available from 1st August 2018 (the starting date is  
flexible) and are on the UE07 scale (£32,548 - £38,833). The posts  
will be fixed term for 36 months with the possibility of extension to  
48 months depending on funding.

The closing date is 5pm GMT on 06 July 2018.

** **** Overview ****
**
** As processor and system manufacturers increase the amount of
** both inter- and intra-chip parallelism it becomes crucial to
** provide the software industry with high-level, clean and efficient
** tools for parallel programming. Parallel and distributed programming
** methodologies are currently dominated by low-level techniques such
** as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared
** memory mechanisms. Higher-level, structured approaches offer many
** possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable
** exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism. Since 2001 the HLPP series
** of workshops/symposia has been a forum for researchers developing
** state-of-the-art concepts, tools and applications for high-level
** parallel programming. The general emphasis is on software quality,
** programming productivity and high-level performance models.

Hi all,

Our network is now more than half-way through its EPSRC funding
duration. We have organized a range of events across the country over
the past two years, with further upcoming events announced below. Do
get in touch if you would like to host your own Manycore workshop.

In other news, we have produced some MaRIONet laptop stickers. Email
jeremy.singer at glasgow.ac.uk with your snail mail address if you want
us to post you a laptop sticker.

Best regards,
Jeremy

The UK Manycore summer school was held at the School of Computing
Science, 16-20 July. We welcomed over 40 visitors, most of them were
UK-based PhD students but we had some delegates from exotic places
like ETHZ and Princeton. Speakers included representatives from
industry and academia.

Over the week, students found out about various aspects of manycore
technology, from low-level processor architecture, through virtual
machines and programming languages, up to high-level applications. We
also enjoyed an excursion to Loch Lomond and a ceilidh at the student
union, to give our visitors an authentic taste of Scotland.

The summer school was possible thanks to generous sponsorship from
EPSRC and SICSA. Slides and photos are archived at

PRiME is pleased to announce the release of PRiME Framework which
enables application- and platform-agnostic runtime management.  Being
able to balance the competing needs of application performance with
the minimisation of system power is essential for future systems and
one way to achieve this is with application-aware runtime management
of system behaviour. There are many runtime management approaches;
however, many are tied to specific hardware or applications, this
makes direct comparison challenging and complicates implementation
with new platforms and applications.  PRiME researchers have developed
a tool, Prime Framework, for application and platform agnostic runtime
management that enables portability of runtime management
approaches. We achieve this by considering a system as three distinct
layers with abstracted communication between them.  The PRiME
Framework has two main features: It allows users, who are developing
runtime managers for new systems, to directly compare different
approaches to identify the best one or check how well their approach
compares to the state of the art. It simplifies development effort as
runtime managers don't need device or application specific code
allowing the users to quickly prototype and test an idea in a few
lines of code. "The PRiME Framework is a step change in cross-layer
system optimisation of future many-core and heterogeneous systems. It
benefits runtime management researchers and developers by reducing
development overhead and enabling the direct comparison of
approaches," said Professor Bashir Al-Hashimi. Details of the tool
methodology have been accepted for publication in ReCoSoC 2018 and PEC
2018 both of which will be published shortly.  PRiME Framework is
available to download on:

aspects such as reuse of language runtimes, modular implementation, language
design and compilation strategies. By bringing together both researchers and
practitioners, the workshop aims to enable a diverse discussion on how
languages and runtimes are currently being utilized, and where they need to
improve further.

Relevant topics include, but are definitely not limited to, the following:

- Extensible VM design (compiler- or interpreter-based VMs)
- Reusable components (e.g. interpreters, garbage collectors, ...)
- Static and dynamic compilation techniques
- Techniques for targeting high-level languages such as JavaScript
- Interoperability between languages
- Tooling support (e.g. debugging, profiling, etc.)
- Programming language development environments
- Case studies of existing language implementation approaches
- Language implementation challenges and trade-offs
- Surveys and usage reports to understand usage in the wild
- Ideas for more predictable performance
- Ideas for how VMs could take advantage of new hardware features
- Ideas for how we should build languages in the future

Subject: [Marionet] Postdoctoral Position at St Andrews
Message-ID: <F07D96DA-3F03-4139-B1F6-DE941457BF50@kevinhammond.net>

[Please pass on to anyone suitable.  Happy Christmas! Kevin]

The Functional Programming Group seeks a Post Doctoral Research Fellow to work on the recent funded 3-year EU Horizon 2020 Serums project, and the ongoing EU Horizon 2020 TeamPlay project (https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu) <https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu)/>. The TeamPlay project aims to develop new, formally-motivated, techniques that will allow execution time, energy usage, security, and other important non-functional properties of parallel software to be treated effectively, and as first-class citizens. We will build this into a toolbox for developing highly parallel software for low-energy systems, as required by the internet of things, cyber-physical systems etc.

The TeamPlay approach will allow programs to reflect directly on their own time, energy consumption, security, etc., as well as enabling the developer to reason about both the functional and the non-functional properties of their software at the source code level.

The post will require skills in the development and application of lightweight formal methods to non-functional properties, including time, energy and/or security.

Informal enquiries can be directed to Professor Kevin Hammond (kevin at kevinhamond.net <mailto:kevin at kevinhamond.net>). 

The role may be offered on either a full-time or part-time basis, and flexible working may be available to suit the right candidate(s).  More than one appointment may be made, with a suitable division of responsibilities.*Appointment at grade 7 (salary £40,792 - £50,132 per annum) will be considered for candidate with enhanced skills/knowledge of the area with the job description to be amended accordingly. 

Applications are particularly welcome from women and other groups who are under-represented in Computer Science posts at the University.
Please contact Kevin Hammond (kevin at kevinhammond.net <mailto:kevin at kevinhammond.net>) if you would like to discuss the position. 
Deadline for applications is 11/1/19.

Subject: [Marionet] Call for Papers, The Programming Journal, Volume 4,
	Issue 1 & 2
Message-ID: <70AC79DB-36B7-4DB0-B23D-7301116C3740@kent.ac.uk>

========================================================================
                        The Programming Journal

          The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming


              Call for Papers for Volume 4, Issue 1 & 2

                 http://programming-journal.org/cfp/
                       Follow us @programmingconf
========================================================================

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming was created with the
goal of placing the wonderful art of programming on the map of scholarly
works. Many academic journals and conferences exist that publish research
related to programming, starting with programming languages, software
engineering, and expanding to the whole Computer Science field. Yet, many
of us feel that, as the field of Computer Science expanded, programming,
in itself, has been neglected to a secondary role not worthy of scholarly
attention. That is a serious gap, as much of the progress in Computer
Science lies on the basis of computer programs, the people who write
Them, and the concepts and tools available to them to express
computational tasks.

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming aims at closing this
gap by focusing primarily on programming: the art itself (programming
styles, pearls, models, languages), the emerging science of understanding
what works and what doesn’t work in general and in specific contexts,
as well as more established engineering and mathematical perspectives.


We solicit papers describing work from one of the following perspectives:

  Art: knowledge and technical skills acquired through practice and
       personal experiences. Examples include libraries, frameworks,
       languages, APIs, programming models and styles, programming
       pearls, and essays about programming.

  Science (Theoretical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through mathematical formalisms. Examples include formal
       programming models and proofs.

  Science (Empirical): knowledge and technical skills acquired
       through experiments and systematic observations. Examples
       include user studies and programming-related data mining.

  Engineering: knowledge and technical skills acquired through
       designing and building large systems and through calculated
       application of principles in building those systems.
       Examples include measurements of artifacts’ properties,
       development processes and tools, and quality assurance methods.

Independent of the type of work, the journal accepts submissions covering several areas of expertise, including but not limited to:

 - General-purpose programming
 - Data mining and machine learning programming, and for programming
 - Database programming
 - Distributed systems programming
 - Graphics and GPU programming
 - Interpreters, virtual machines, and compilers
 - Metaprogramming and reflection
 - Model-based development
 - Modularity and separation of concerns
 - Parallel and multi-core programming
 - Program verification
 - Programming education
 - Programming environments
 - Security programming
 - Social coding
 - Testing and debugging
 - User interface programming
 - Visual and live programming

All details, including the selection process are described on
  http://programming-journal.org/cfp/

Details on the submission processed are available at
  http://programming-journal.org/submission/

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present at the
<Programming>’20 conference in early 2020. Further details will be
announced in April 2019 at <Programming>’19:
  https://2019.programming-conference.org/

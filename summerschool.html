  <h2 class="content-subhead">Many Core Summerschool 2018</h2>

  <h4>15th to 20th July 2018</h4>
  <h4>University of Glasgow</h4>
  <p>
  The transition to manycore systems is arguably the greatest challenge facing the ICT industry, Computational Science, and Computing Science research. The manycore revolution is fundamentally changing multiple levels of the computation execution stack: from processor architecture, through systems software, to applications.
<br>
The MaRIONet Summerschool offers researchers an opportunity to learn theory and practice of a range of emerging many core technologies from leading academic and industrial researchers
  <br> <br>
  
    The PhD Summerschool will be held from <strong>Sunday 15th</strong> to <strong>Friday 20th July 2018</strong> at the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>.
</p>
  <h2>Registration</h2>
  <p>Registration is <strong>free</strong> for PhD students and early career researcher(Post-Docs), due to sponsorship from the <a href="http://manycore.org.uk">UK Manycore Network</a> and <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/"> SICSA </a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
	<a href="form.html"> Registration will be open shortly through the UK Manycore Network Webpage </a>and requires a letter of support from your supervisor or line manager.

<br/>Event-driven computing

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapseAndyBrown">
All modern computers are based on an idea first published by Alan Turing as a thought experiment to support his proof of key results about the fundamentals of computability. His concept of the Universal Machine forms the theoretical foundation for the stored-program computer, conceived in practical terms by von Neumann, Eckert and Mauchly, and which first became an engineering reality in the Manchester Baby machine and soon thereafter as a practical computing service supported by Maurice Wilke’s EDSAC in Cambridge. At the heart of this idea is the concept of sequential execution: each "instruction" starts with the state of the machine when the preceding instruction has completed, and leaves the machine in a well-defined state for its successor. High-speed implementations bend the actual timing of instruction execution as far as it will go without breaking semantics, but still emulate the sequential model.
<br>
The history of advances in computing has revolved around making this very simple execution model go faster, partly through bending the timing of instruction execution, but mainly through making transistors smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient, all thanks to Moore’s Law. This approach has delivered spectacular progress for over 50 years, but has hit a brick wall – the power wall is much vaunted; in reality the wall is multidimensional and complex, but solid nevertheless. Since then largely illusory (marketing) advances in performance have been delivered through multi-core and then many-core parallelism – putting a modest number of sequential execution engines on the same chip, whose potential (marketing) performance can rarely be realized due to the difficulty inherent in trying to make sequential programs work together in parallel.
<br>
The time has come to look again at the fundamentals of computation: to abandon sequential instruction execution as the only model of computation. Alternatives to sequential execution are all around us, including the massive parallel computing resource on a modern FPGA, and the vast complex of biological neurons inside each of our brains. The only minor difficulty is that we do not yet have any general theory of computing on such huge, distributed, networked resources. It’s time that changed. Sequential computing is not natural, it's not efficient and, in fact, the only thing it has going for it is that it's easy.
<br>
In these seminars, we present a little bit of history, and then suggest an alternative way of approaching real-world engineering computing problems - principally simulation, although this is a very broad term. This alternative approach is that of event-based computation - where we allow our model of a system to "relax" into some reasonable solution configuration corresponding to reality, in exactly the same way as occurs in nature. We generalise the issue almost beyond recognition, and suggest ways in which we might realise this alternative approach. Finally, we briefly discuss some of the array of application domains for which this approach offers a tremendous return on effort.

Virtual machines are ubiquitous. Most popular language implementations use VMs, VMs are widely deployed in production, and are an enabling technology for many clouds. And yet relatively few know what goes on inside a VM, and almost all are unaware of the long and complex history of VM technologies. This talk will attempt to induct you into the inner circle of the VM cognoscenti.

<br/>Whole Systems Energy Transparency: More power to software developers!

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapsKerstin">
Energy efficiency is now a major, if not the major, constraint in electronic systems engineering. Significant progress has been made in low power hardware design for more than a decade. The potential for savings is now far greater at the higher levels of abstraction in the system stack. The greatest savings are expected from energy consumption-aware software. Promoting energy efficiency to a first class software design goal is therefore an urgent research challenge. Designing software for energy efficiency requires visibility of energy consumption from the hardware, where the energy is consumed, all the way through to the programs that ultimately control what the hardware does. This visibility is termed energy transparency. Energy transparency enables a deeper understanding of how algorithms and coding impact on the energy consumption of a computation when executed on hardware. It is a key prerequisite for informed design space exploration and helps system designers to find the optimal tradeoff between performance, accuracy and energy consumption of a computation. In this session I will outline our approach, techniques and recent results towards giving "more power" to software developers. We will cover energy monitoring of software, energy modelling at different abstraction levels, including insights into how data affects the energy consumption of a computation, and static analysis techniques for energy consumption estimation.

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapsHans">
This lecture will provide an overview of recent ideas in high-performance implementations of graph analytics, with a focus on shared memory systems. We will discuss programming models and runtime system implementation for a class of algorithms that conform to the Pregel model. We will analyse characteristics of graph algorithms and explain the impact of these characteristics on performance. We will review performance optimisations to address memory locality issues, to perform NUMA-aware data placement and code scheduling, and to achieve load balance through graph partitioning. Central to these optimisations is the understanding of write-sets in graph algorithms and the alignment of graph partitioning to these write-sets. A practical, hands-on session will give participants experience with these techniques.

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapseMarcoCianfriglia">
High-performance libraries expose multiple tunable parameters that influence the performance.
Traditionally, such parameters are tuned and hardcoded for a given target architecture to perform well for
typical inputs (e.g. large operand sizes). Emerging AI and Big Data applications, however, are often
data-driven, rendering the conventional approach ineffective.
<br/>
In this talk, we describe our work-in-progress on designing adaptive GPU libraries for data-driven
applications. We proceed in three stages. First, starting with some tractable subsets of the parameter
space, we evaluate various search strategies to discover highly performant parameter combinations for a
range of inputs in reasonable time. Second, we use the discovered combinations to train models that most
accurately predict the best performing combination for a given input. Third, we explore trade-offs
between prediction accuracy and runtime overhead to make this approach feasible in practice.
<br/>
We introduce runtime adaptation to the CLBlast library which we use with the Caffe framework, and
study its effects across several convolutional neural networks, and GPU architectures for mobile and
desktop platforms. Our workflows are implemented using the Collective Knowledge framework for
collaborative and reproducible R&D (cknowledge.org), and will be extended to crowdsource
experimentation across diverse platforms provided by volunteers. </div>

We present optimisations applied to a bespoke biophysical
molecular dynamics simulation designed to investigate
chromosome condensation. Our primary focus is on domainspecific
algorithmic improvements to determining short-range
interaction forces between particles, as certain qualities of the
simulation render traditional methods less effective. We implement
tuned versions of the code for both traditional CPU
architectures and the modern many-core architecture found in
the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor and compare their effectiveness.
We achieve speed-ups starting at a factor of 10 over the original
code, facilitating more detailed and larger-scale experiments.

Emerging multicore and manycore architectures offer major advantages in terms of performance and low energy usage. We are already seeing designs for 100+ cores CPUs and 1000+ cores GPUs, offering significant potential for parallelism. However, programming models are lagging behind. Exploiting the potential of new parallel systems, even using higher-level programming models, is highly challenging.
<br/>
Fundamentally:<br/>
"Parallelism is too hard for programmers today"<br/>
Bjarne Stroustrup, Inventor of C++<br/>
ParaFormance is a novel software toolset for C and C++ that allows software developers to optimise systems for performance and energy consumption by exploiting parallelism quickly and easy. Our ParaFormance tool discovers the potential areas in the application for parallelism, refactors it to introduce the parallel business logic automatically and checks it for thread-safety and runtime bugs. Our case studies have shown 2.5 million lines of code analysed and refactored using ParaFormance, that’s 1 month of manual effort reduced to around 5 minutes. In this talk I will introduce the ParaFormance toolset and give a demonstration of it on a realistic use-case.

The analysis of graph-structured data is gaining importance due to its relevance to social media and big data. Due to the interconnection patterns in social network graphs, the performance of graph analytics is impeded by irregular memory accesses patterns which expose memory latency.
<br/>
The emergence of big data requires fundamental new methodology for data analysis, processing, and information extraction. The main challenge here is to perform efficient and robust data processing, while adapting to the underlying resource availability in a dynamic, large-scale computing environment. Do we really need high performance computers or a large cluster computing? I would introduce our recent work on the graph processing that have billion-scale of vertices and edges in a commodity single computer, which requires secondary storage as external memory. Executing algorithms results in access to such secondary storage and performance of I/O takes an important role, regardless of the algorithmic complexity or runtime efficiency of the actual algorithm in use.

The analysis of graph-structured data is gaining importance due to its relevance to social media and big data. Due to the interconnection patterns in social network graphs, the performance of graph analytics is impeded by irregular memory accesses patterns which expose memory latency.
<br/>
This talk presents our recent work on high-performance graph analytics. We will demonstrate how graph partitioning is crucial to tame memory locality and how it can be used to map graph analytics to non-uniform memory architectures (NUMA). Key to the graph partitioning algorithm is that it achieves memory locality, avoids overlap in write-sets between threads and is efficient to apply. We will discuss the difficulties of making graph partitioning scalable as a result of a strongly biased degree distribution in the partitions. We will demonstrate solutions to these problems. We will moreover identify new opportunities to switch between different representations of the graph during graph traversal in order to maximise processing speed.
<br/>
These ideas are implemented in GraphGrind, an open source framework for graph analytics on shared memory systems.

<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapsePabloGonzales">
Current research in the field of computational biology often involves
simulations on high-performance computer clusters. It is crucial that the code
of such simulations is efficient and correctly reflects the model
specifications. 
In this paper, we present an optimization strategy for simulations of
biological dynamics using Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors, demonstrated by a
winning entry of the ``Intel Modern Code Developer Challenge'' competition.
These optimizations allow simulating various biological mechanisms, in
particular, the simulation of millions of cell agents, their proliferation,
movements and interactions in 3D space. Overall, our results demonstrate a
powerful approach to implement and conduct very detailed and large-scale
computational simulations for biological research. We also highlight the main
difficulties faced when developing such optimizations, in particular, the
changing simulation load over time, the dependencies between different
optimization techniques and counter-intuitive effects in the speed of the
optimized solution. The overall speedup of 320x shows a good parallel
scalability.

<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapseJoseNunez">
Recent advances in hardware compilers and synthesis tools have resulted in significant increases in hardware design productivity while heterogeneous chips that combine CPUs and FPGAs can be used to distribute processing so that the tasks present in an algorithm map to the most suitable processing element. This software defined high-level design environments use general purpose languages such as C++ and OpenCL without requiring hardware description language expertise. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance an existing software defined framework to reduce overheads and enable the utilisation of all the programmable processing resources present in the system in parallel to optional hardware accelerators. Instead of selecting the best processing resource for a task and simply offloading we create a dynamic scheduler that distributes the task between all processing resources in an optimal way. A new hardware platform is created based on interrupts that removes spin-locks and allows the processing resources to sleep when no performing useful work. Performance and functional portability between 32-bit and 64-bit chips using the same source code with different CPU and FPGA hardware is investigated. The performance and energy evaluation shows up to 40% reduction in execution time when the CPU cores assist FPGA execution at the same level of energy requirements depending on hardware speed-ups.

  Abstract

<div class="collapse abstract" id="collapseKevinHammond">
Structured parallelism using nested algorithmic skeletons can greatly ease the task of writing parallel software, since common, but hard-to-debug problems such as race conditions are eliminated by design. However, choosing the right combination of algorithmic skeletons to yield good parallel speedups for a specific program on a specific parallel architecture is still a difficult problem. This talk introduces the unifying notion of hylomorphisms, a general recursion pattern, to make it possible to reason about both functional correctness properties and about extra-functional timing properties of structured parallel programs. Using our approach, we can now automatically and statically choose the provably optimal parallel structure for a given program with respect to a parallel architecture or a class of architectures.

<h2>Location</h2>
The UKMAC 2017 event was held at the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/">Computer Science</a> department <a href="http://campus-cms.warwick.ac.uk/share/6940dbbb12255525a079e22c89561b86">[location]</a> at the University of Warwick in Room <b>CS1.04</b>.
Please see Warwick <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/">campus maps</a> for more info. There is a <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/maps/campusmap/CampusMap-onlineCrops-A4_09-16-CENTRAL.pdf">downloadable PDF map</a>.


<h2>Arrival</h2>
<b>Parking:</b>
<br> There is parking on campus that is pay and display. Parking for the day is <b>&#163;4.50.</b>
<br> The car park 15 is just by the back of the CS department. 
<br> We are also able to reserve some spaces in the arts centre car park (Near Psychology and Senate house on the map). The top two floors of this car park can be reserved for events up to 11am. There is still a requirement to pay and display but you would have a guaranteed space. If you wish to have a reserve parking space please <a href="http://manycore.org.uk/contact.html">contact us</a> directly.
<br>Alternatively, for anyone staying overnight in Scarman house, there is free parking for them at the conference centre.
<br>
<b>Train:</b>
<br>
The easiest approach to the department is to get a train to Coventry train station and then take the number 11 or number 12 bus onto campus (arriving at the Bus Interchange). Alternatively, from Leamington Spa (if you happen to be on that train line), you can catch bus U1 onto campus.
<br>
Those that fancy more of a walk can get off at Canley station and can get to the campus with a 20 minute walk down Sir Henry Parkes Road, across the A45, continue on Sir Henry Parkes Road until you approach Cannon Park. Follow the road past Cannon Park and eventually you will arrive at the roundabout in the bottom right corner of this <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/maps/campusmap/CampusMap-onlineCrops-A4_09-16-CENTRAL.pdf">map</a>. It is a short walk from here to the Computer Science department.

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
If people wish to stay overnight, there is accommodation on campus in <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/spaces/scarman/">Scarman House</a>. Although this is a conference centre, its also a hotel that can be booked. Unfortunately there are no discounts available, since the workshop is being held in the Computer Science department. Please note that UKMAC is not able to  cover any travel/accomodation costs.
